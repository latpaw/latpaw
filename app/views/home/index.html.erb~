The Django framework
Object-relational mapper

Define your data models entirely in Python. You get a rich, dynamic database-access API for free — but you can still write SQL if needed.
Automatic admin interface

Save yourself the tedious work of creating interfaces for people to add and update content. Django does that automatically, and it's production-ready.
Elegant URL design

Design pretty, cruft-free URLs with no framework-specific limitations. Be as flexible as you like.
Template system

Use Django's powerful, extensible and designer-friendly template language to separate design, content and Python code.
Cache system
